# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before you begin:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. The project you wish to add this workflow to should have a Dockerfile.
#   - If you don't have a Dockerfile at the repository root,
#     or if it is named differently (eg. 'Containerfile'), see the buildah-build step.
#   - The buildah-build step can be replaced with any other image build step if you do not wish to use a Dockerfile.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è This workflow requires some configuration.
# 1. ‚úèÔ∏è Modify the top-level 'env' fields marked with the pencil ‚úèÔ∏è to fit your project.
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN secrets.
#   - Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - and https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
# 3. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.
